# PHPantom — Bug Fixes

Every bug below must be fixed at its root cause. "Detect the
symptom and suppress the diagnostic" is not an acceptable fix.
If the type resolution pipeline produces wrong data, fix the
pipeline so it produces correct data. Downstream consumers
(diagnostics, hover, completion, definition) should never need
to second-guess upstream output.





## B13. Remaining template inference gaps

**Discovered:** SKIP audit of
`tests/psalm_assertions/template_class_template_extends.php`.

Constructor generic inference through inherited constructors,
case-insensitive method lookup, function-level `@template`
inference through generic wrapper params, function name
resolution in multi-namespace files, `@extends` with swapped
parameter order, `__get` magic method with `key-of<T>`/`T[K]`,
`@template-implements` return type inheritance from stub
interfaces, and class-level generic substitution in method
call return types via `@var` annotations are now fixed.
Remaining gaps:

- **Array-access assignment overwrites `@var` generic type on
  `ArrayAccess` objects**: `$obj[$key] = $val` on an object that
  implements `ArrayAccess` causes the forward walker to lose the
  `@var` generic annotation on `$obj`. Works correctly when there
  is no array-access assignment between the `@var` and the method
  call.
- **Method-level `@template` with `key-of<T>` bound and `T[K]` return**:
  `key-of<T>`, `value-of<T>`, and `T[K]` now evaluate correctly after
  class-level template substitution. However, inferring a method-level
  template parameter `K` from a string literal argument (to resolve
  `T[K]` at a specific call site) is not yet supported.

**Tests:** SKIPs in `tests/psalm_assertions/template_class_template_extends.php`
(line 500).




## B14. Template/generic resolution in multi-namespace test files

**Discovered:** SKIP audit of
`tests/psalm_assertions/template_class_template.php`.

Remaining failures are all caused by the multi-namespace
infrastructure limitation: `FileContext.namespace` stores only the
first namespace, so the class loader resolves bare names (e.g.
`Foo`, `Collection`) against the wrong namespace when the same
short name appears in multiple namespace blocks within one file.

**Tests:** SKIPs in `tests/psalm_assertions/template_class_template.php`
(lines 16, 29, 41, 56, 68, 122, 602, 752, 788).



## B16. PDOStatement fetch mode-dependent return types

**Blocked on:** [phpstorm-stubs#1882](https://github.com/JetBrains/phpstorm-stubs/pull/1882)

`PDOStatement::fetch()` and `PDOStatement::fetchAll()` return
different types depending on the fetch mode constant passed as
the first argument. Once the upstream PR is merged and we update
our stubs, the existing conditional return type support should
handle this automatically.

**Tests:** SKIPs in `tests/psalm_assertions/method_call.php`
(lines 79-85, 87-89).


## Bulk un-SKIP after fixes

There are `// SKIP` markers across `tests/phpstan_nsrt/*.php` and
`tests/psalm_assertions/*.php` covering gaps in the type engine.
When working on any type engine improvement, grep for `// SKIP` in
the assertion files to find tests that may now pass. Run
`cargo nextest run --test assert_type_runner --no-fail-fast` with
the SKIP removed to verify.

Some SKIPs are **out of scope** for an LSP (value-range tracking,
int overflow detection, constant-expression folding, `*NEVER*`
after impossible conditions, `*ERROR*` diagnostics). These should
just be removed from the test files.
