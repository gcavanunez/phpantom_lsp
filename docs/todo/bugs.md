# PHPantom — Bug Fixes

Every bug below must be fixed at its root cause. "Detect the
symptom and suppress the diagnostic" is not an acceptable fix.
If the type resolution pipeline produces wrong data, fix the
pipeline so it produces correct data. Downstream consumers
(diagnostics, hover, completion, definition) should never need
to second-guess upstream output.





## B13. Remaining template inference gaps

**Discovered:** SKIP audit of
`tests/psalm_assertions/template_class_template_extends.php`.

Constructor generic inference through inherited constructors,
case-insensitive method lookup, and function-level `@template`
inference through generic wrapper params are now fixed.
Remaining gaps:

- **Function name resolution in multi-namespace files**: bare
  function names in namespaced code are not resolved to their FQN,
  so function-level template inference fails in single-file tests
  with multiple namespaces. Works correctly in real projects.
- **`array<TKey, TValue>` constructor inference**: multi-arg array
  generic params in constructors (e.g. `@param array<TKey,TValue> $kv`)
  do not infer key/value types separately.
- **`key-of<T>` and indexed access types** (`T[K]`): advanced type
  operators not yet supported.

**Tests:** SKIPs in `tests/psalm_assertions/template_class_template_extends.php`
(lines 177, 227, 427, 500, 681-682, 737-738, 843 (namespace)).


## B14. Template/generic resolution in namespace-level and complex scenarios

**Discovered:** SKIP audit of
`tests/psalm_assertions/template_class_template.php`.

Several template resolution patterns fail:

- Hover fails in namespace-level code with iterator generics
  (outside any class/function body)
- `class-string<T>` generic resolution for factory patterns
- `self` not resolved to declaring class in inherited static
  methods (returns parent's template param name instead)
- `@property` virtual members with unresolved templates
- `__get` with template return type not resolved
- Intersection types with template interfaces
- Method-level template on static method returning generic
- `WeakReference::create` generic resolution

Many of these fail in the multi-namespace Psalm test file because
`FileContext.namespace` stores only the first namespace, so the
class loader resolves bare names (e.g. `Foo`) against the wrong
namespace. Items that work correctly in single-namespace contexts
(template bound defaults, static method-level templates) are blocked
only by this infrastructure limitation.

**Tests:** SKIPs in `tests/psalm_assertions/template_class_template.php`
(lines 16-17, 29, 41, 56, 68, 122, 191-192, 286-287, 451, 487,
640, 667, 701, 710, 788, 800).


## B15. Loop exit type narrowing

**Discovered:** SKIP audit of `tests/psalm_assertions/loop_do.php`,
`loop_while.php`, `loop_foreach.php`.

After a loop exits (via condition failure or break), the variable
type is not properly narrowed. Examples:

- `do { $a = getA(); } while ($a !== null);` — after the loop,
  `$a` should be `null` but resolves to `A|null`
- `while ($a = getA()) { ... }` — after the loop, `$a` should
  be narrowed by the falsy exit condition
- `foreach` loop variable not narrowed away from initial `null`
  after non-empty iteration
- Break-in-else branch type not merged with loop variable
- Assignment from untyped array value inside null check not
  widened to `mixed`

Related to T20 (type narrowing reconciliation engine) and T29
(definite vs possible variable existence tracking).

**Tests:** SKIPs in `tests/psalm_assertions/loop_do.php` (lines
63, 80), `loop_while.php` (lines 39, 91, 115, 152),
`loop_foreach.php` (lines 81, 128, 156, 188, 208).


## B16. PDOStatement fetch mode-dependent return types

**Blocked on:** [phpstorm-stubs#1882](https://github.com/JetBrains/phpstorm-stubs/pull/1882)

`PDOStatement::fetch()` and `PDOStatement::fetchAll()` return
different types depending on the fetch mode constant passed as
the first argument. Once the upstream PR is merged and we update
our stubs, the existing conditional return type support should
handle this automatically.

**Tests:** SKIPs in `tests/psalm_assertions/method_call.php`
(lines 79-85, 87-89).


## B22. Remove redundant stub patches after upstream merge

**Blocked on:** [phpstorm-stubs#1883](https://github.com/JetBrains/phpstorm-stubs/pull/1883)

Most class patches in `stub_patches.rs` are now redundant because
phpstorm-stubs already has the `@template` and `@template-implements`
annotations for `ArrayObject`, `SplDoublyLinkedList`, `SplStack`,
`SplPriorityQueue`, `SplFixedArray`, `SplObjectStorage`, and
`WeakMap`. The upstream PR adds the remaining missing annotations:

- `ArrayIterator` — `@template TKey of array-key`, `@template TValue`,
  `@template-implements SeekableIterator<TKey, TValue>`,
  `@template-implements ArrayAccess<TKey, TValue>`
- `SplQueue` — `@template-extends SplDoublyLinkedList<TValue>`
- `array_reduce` — `@template TCarry`, `@template TValue`,
  `@return TCarry`

Once merged and our embedded stubs are updated, remove all patches
from `stub_patches.rs` that are covered by the upstream annotations.
Verify with the test suite that the stubs' own annotations produce
the same results.


## B17. Stub-level property and method resolution gaps

**Discovered:** SKIP audit of `tests/psalm_assertions/method_call.php`
and `tests/psalm_assertions/property_type.php`.

Several built-in PHP classes have incorrect or missing type
resolution:

- `DateTimeImmutable::sub()` / `modify()` — static return type
  not resolved (should return `MyDate` when called on subclass)
- `SimpleXMLElement` — resolves as `stdClass` instead of itself;
  `asXML()` overloaded return type not resolved; magic property
  access not resolved
- `DOMDocument` — grandparent stub property `ownerDocument` not
  resolved (hover returns no type)
- `DOMNode::$nextSibling` — `self` type alias not resolved to
  concrete class name `Node`
- `SplObjectStorage` — generic defaults (`<never, never>`) not
  inferred for empty construction
- `SplDoublyLinkedList::bottom()` — generic return type not
  resolved
- `@psalm-no-seal-methods` `__call` return type

**Tests:** SKIPs in `tests/psalm_assertions/method_call.php`
(lines 15-16, 31, 40-41, 97),
`tests/psalm_assertions/property_type.php`
(lines 59, 79, 95-96).


## B18. Property type narrowing through OR'd `instanceof`

**Discovered:** SKIP audit of
`tests/psalm_assertions/property_type.php`.

When a property is accessed after an OR'd `instanceof` check
(`$a instanceof B || $a instanceof C`), the property type should
be the union of both branches. Currently only one branch's type
is used.

**Tests:** SKIPs in `tests/psalm_assertions/property_type.php`
(lines 24, 51).


## B19. Return type resolution edge cases

**Discovered:** SKIP audit of
`tests/psalm_assertions/return_type.php`.

Several return type patterns are not resolved:

- `static` return type inside an array generic
  (`@return array<int, static>`)
- Overridden return type not resolved through child class when
  parent declares `@return static`
- Interface method return type not resolved on implementing class
- Arrow function return type inference (`fn(int $x): bool => ...`
  should produce `Closure(int):bool`)
- `(object)` cast of scalar or array not inferred as object shape
  (`object{scalar:int}`, `object{a:int}`)

**Tests:** SKIPs in `tests/psalm_assertions/return_type.php`
(lines 43, 64, 83, 121, 132, 146).


## B20. Mixin method resolution gaps

**Discovered:** SKIP audit of
`tests/psalm_assertions/mixin_annotation.php`.

`@mixin` method resolution fails in these cases:

- Static method called on a class that mixes in another class
- Method on `IteratorIterator` via mixin
- Mixin method return type not resolved through `static`

**Tests:** SKIPs in `tests/psalm_assertions/mixin_annotation.php`
(lines 34, 73, 168).


## B21. Remaining static-late-binding and generics gaps

**Discovered:** SKIP audit of
`tests/phpstan_nsrt/static-late-binding.php`,
`tests/phpstan_nsrt/generics.php`,
`tests/psalm_assertions/annotation.php`,
`tests/psalm_assertions/generator.php`,
`tests/psalm_assertions/trait.php`,
`tests/psalm_assertions/template_function_class_string_template.php`.

Miscellaneous type resolution gaps:

- `$variable::method()` on class-string union does not produce
  union return type (`static-late-binding.php` lines 88, 97)
- `static` keyword not preserved through first-class callable
  invocation (`static-late-binding.php` lines 92-95)
- `@template T of (A|B)` union bound not used as return type for
  `pick()` (`generics.php` line 344)
- Template not resolved through `unbox()` generic function
  (`generics.php` lines 482, 485)
- PHPStan's `T (function traced(), argument)` display format
  (`generics.php` line 499) — out of scope for an LSP
- Loop variable union includes array key type (`annotation.php`
  line 33)
- Loop variable resolves to `null` instead of `null|stdClass`
  (`annotation.php` line 34)
- Escaped backslash in array shape key not normalized
  (`annotation.php` line 71)
- Generator variable hover (`generator.php` lines 40, 87)
- `NoRewindIterator` wrapping generator (`generator.php` line 102)
- Trait method returning `new static()` resolves to trait user
  instead of trait definer (`trait.php` line 46)
- Function-level `@template` with intersection and union types
  (`template_function_class_string_template.php` lines 62, 90, 117)

**Tests:** Referenced in-line above.


## Bulk un-SKIP after fixes

There are `// SKIP` markers across `tests/phpstan_nsrt/*.php` and
`tests/psalm_assertions/*.php` covering gaps in the type engine.
When working on any type engine improvement, grep for `// SKIP` in
the assertion files to find tests that may now pass. Run
`cargo nextest run --test assert_type_runner --no-fail-fast` with
the SKIP removed to verify.

Some SKIPs are **out of scope** for an LSP (value-range tracking,
int overflow detection, constant-expression folding, `*NEVER*`
after impossible conditions, `*ERROR*` diagnostics). These should
just be removed from the test files.
